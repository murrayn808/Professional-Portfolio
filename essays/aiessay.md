## Artificial Intelligence in Education and Software Engineering


Artificial Intelligence (AI) is bringing big changes in many jobs, and it's making a really important impact on education, especially in Software Engineering. As technology gets better, AI is becoming super important in changing how we teach, learn, and use what we know. In Software Engineering, using AI is especially helpful. It can make learning better, make development (creating software) easier, and help software systems grow and improve.

In education, AI is used to make learning personal, help with different learning styles, and give smart tutoring. This makes education easier to understand and more effective. In Software Engineering classes, AI tools are used to copy real-life situations, help fix mistakes, and support working together on coding. This way, it helps connect what we learn in theory with how we use it in real projects.
