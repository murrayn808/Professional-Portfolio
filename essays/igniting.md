What do you think about Javascript so far? If youâ€™re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?

What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?

The Wonders of JavaScript

So far I enjoy JavaScript a lot more than what I am used to which is C. C has a different approach to object-oriented programming using structs and functions and unlike JavaScript it doesn't have built-in support for classes and prototypes. 

Another difference in JavaScript that's significant is the ability to declare variables without data types. C is a statically typed language, where you must explicitly specify the data type for each variable such as int, char, unsigned int, double etc. However, in JavaScript you can simply write var, let or const and it seems a lot less strict about data types. I can imagine that as we progress through the course start to code more complex projects that this could be an issue. There must be some disadvantages to having looser coding rules. I think JavaScript's dynamic typing is advantageous when you need more flexibility in your code as compared to C. C's static typing is advantageous in situations where strong type safety is critical, such as system-level programming or safety-critical applications, ensuring that variable types are explicitly defined and preventing potential 

JavaScript's dynamic arrays, defined using square brackets, are advantageous for scenarios where the size of the data structure may change dynamically, as is often the case in web applications. C's statically sized arrays with specific type declarations are more suitable for situations where memory efficiency and predictability are critical, such as embedded systems with limited resources.
