## Javascript Coding Standards

  Coding Standards are important for keeping the process of developing software consistent and predictable. When it comes to learning the coding standards for this class, there’s more to creating a JavaScript code than writing the functions and data themselves. First, an appropriate coding environment must be configured with the right settings to support the code we want to create. For example, in ICS 314 we code in IntelliJ which is an IDE or integrated development environment and ESLint was chosen as the code checker for this class. Using IntelliJ allows us to connect files that are coded/created locally to GitHub and also allows downloading packages and libraries from the internet. Essentially it organizes this program as a whole locally on the computer and pushes it online when needed. This type of coding environment is good because in software development, online repositories are used for multiple software engineers to collaborate on projects at the same time. In this process, everyone involved also shares the same packages that are uploaded to the repository.
	I personally think that ESLint is great for troubleshooting code and keeping things looking neat and in working order. However, fully trusting ESLint warnings and revisions can break code if the user is not aware of what they are doing. It is a good tool for a coder that has an understanding of what they want in their code. If someone autocorrects code without keeping track of their variables and references they can end up in a bigger mess if they aren’t careful.
