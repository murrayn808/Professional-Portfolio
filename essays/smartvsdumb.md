Smart vs. Dumb Questions
In my smart question example, I found a StackOverflow post that aligns with the principles of asking questions effectively, as outlined by Eric Steven Raymond and Rick Moen in "How to Ask Questions the Smart Way." Smart questions are characterized by:

-Explicitness
-Meaningful and specific subject headers
-Diligent research
-Precision and informativeness
-Describing symptoms, not guesses
-Chronological description
-Focusing on the goal, not the steps

The chosen smart question asks, "Why is processing a sorted array faster than an unsorted array?" The poster provides C++ code and test results, highlighting the difference sorting makes in execution time. They also compare the results in Java. One user's response discusses processor-level "branch prediction" and offers an optimized solution using bitwise operations.
This question is smart because it follows these guidelines, presenting a clear issue, relevant header, and well-researched context.
In contrast, the dumb question lacks a detailed description, has a vague header, lacks visuals, and appears to be written in poor English. StackOverflow likely closed it due to its low quality.
