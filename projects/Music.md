summary: "This is a song I started working on with one of my close friends this summer. It's still pretty raw and needs some better mixing and mastering but this is what we have so far. I'm singing and playing the guitar while he recorded the bass and drums."

This is a snippet of a song I started working on with one of my close friends recently. It's still pretty rough and needs some better mixing and mastering but this is what we have so far. I'm singing and playing the guitar while he recorded the bass and drums. Definitely reuploading this in the future.

Writing songs and making music is one thing I really like to do outside of programming.
