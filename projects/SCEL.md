The Smart Campus Energy Lab is led by Dr. Anthony Kuh, a professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

Our goal is to support efforts in creating new technologies, techniques and products related to sustainability or renewable energy. We are primarily a student-led lab that strives to achieve this by promoting teamwork, communication, and lifelong learning.
