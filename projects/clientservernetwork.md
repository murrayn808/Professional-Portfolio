This is a project I worked on with me and 2 other team members to create a simple client server network for my Data Structures and Algorithms class.

In this project, we were to create and configure a network in which a host computer can send commands to other connected computers using pipes, sockets and a switch. In this network, the host computer can download files, upload files, and send and recieve ping messages from other computers. 

Here is a [link](https://github.com/murrayn808/EE367L_clientservernetwork) to the repository.
