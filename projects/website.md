This is a web application that I helped create as a team project in EE 491F, Summer 2022. The project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive web site.

This website is implemented using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), a cloud platform and [Docker](https://gdevillele.github.io/compose/django/), a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Within two weeks, we created a website where users can create and upload posts and react to other postings through a like/dislike system.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including Django and PostGreSQL for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming. 

Here is some example code of our django application:
