This is a web application that I helped create as a team project in EE 491F, Summer 2022. The project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive web site.

This website is implemented using Heroku, a cloud platform and Docker, a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Within two weeks, we created a website that implements several types of reservations including flights, hotels, and car rentals.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming. 

Here is some example code to illustrate Simple Schema use:
